Javascript color game

This is a color game where you guess the right color based on the given rgb value.  This isn't my original creation, was part of colt steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on Udemy [https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

I'm running through the course to brush up on my skills and to fill in any gaps I have.
